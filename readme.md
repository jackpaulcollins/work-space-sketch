# Ninety-Five - Design Project to Practice Sketch



#### By **Jack Collins**

### Description

* _The purpose of this project is to practice the initial stage of developing a website for a client. It implements story based development, sketching by hand first, and wireframing/prototyping using the Sketch app_

### Target Users

* _The ideal user of Ninety-Five are young professionals from all backgrounds. The brand emphasizes inclusivity and individual safety. From tech, to blue collar, Ninety-Five hopes to attract all types._



### Potential User Stories

###### Needs
* _Both a communal place to book jobs, and a private meeting area_
* _Good internet connection, and urban location_

###### Pain Points
* _boring, cramped offices that he and his employees dislike_


###### How we can serve

###### Needs

* _no distractions_
* _Feeling of community while she works on admin stuff_

###### Pain Points
* _Stuffy offices that make her clients uncomfortable_
* _Depressing work area when she isn't working directly with clients_


###### How we can serve

* _Raychel can rent one of our private offices with sound proofing to limit distractions_
* _When Raychel is working on administrative tasks she is welcome to work in the communal workspace so she feels energized and social_

#### Sam
##### Sam is a young freelance web developer who wants to feel comfortable and free to express herself
###### Needs
* _Judgement Free Space_
* _Feeling of community_

###### Pain Points
* _Feeling isolated in traditional office setting_

###### How we can serve
* _Sam can feel confident that she'll feel free to be whoever she wants knowing that we fully vet all of our potential tenants, and make sure they adhere to a code of conduct that includes non-discrimination and inclusivity_

### Differentiation

* _I'm confident that Ninety-Five can be succesful because it sets itself apart from other shared workspace companies by:

  -Choosing a location outside of downtown, lowering overhead and freeing up resources to invest in the workspace environment
  -Providing a superior web presence. Many similar companies have websites that are too busy, and have little focus on the actual aesthetic or values of the company.
