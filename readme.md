###### Needs

#### Sam

* _Judgement Free Space_
* _Feeling of community_

###### Pain Points
* _Feeling isolated in traditional office setting_

###### How we can serve
* _Sam can feel confident that she'll feel free to be whoever she wants knowing that we fully vet all of our potential tenants, and make sure they adhere to a code of conduct that includes non-discrimination and inclusivity_

### Differentiation

* _I'm confident that Ninety-Five can be succesful because it sets itself apart from other shared workspace companies by:

  -Choosing a location outside of downtown, lowering overhead and freeing up resources to invest in the workspace environment
  -Providing a superior web presence. Many similar companies have websites that are too busy, and have little focus on the actual aesthetic or values of the company.
